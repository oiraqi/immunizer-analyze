This is the Java implementation of the analysis microservice of [Immunizer: The Collaborative Cloud-based Unsupervised Software Immunity Framework](https://github.com/oiraqi/immunizer). It leverages distributed and parallel processing thanks to cluster-computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Google DataFlow, abstracted and unified through Apache Beam.
